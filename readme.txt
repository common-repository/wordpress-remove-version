== Description == 
Wordpress Remove Version securely removes the version
number from both the site header and the rss feed using the
the_generator filter.

== Installation == 
Just upload the file to your plugins directory or install via the
dashboard and activate. I did notice that the rss feeds are cached and
they need to be flushed. There are many plugins in the plugins directory
that accomplishes this.If you do not want to use a plugin you can wait
for the cache to automatically refresh but when you post a new post the
cache will refresh and generate a new post.
